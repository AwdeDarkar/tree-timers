# Tree Timers
This is an experiment in hierarchical timers and also a project to help myself get more comfortable
with typescript in react.

The timers are meant to work as a kind of 'todo' list where a parent timer is a task and children
are sub-tasks.

## See it in action
You can see it running on [Github pages](https://awdedarkar.github.io/tree-timers).

## Run it locally
You can also run the app in your local browser. After cloning the repository run,

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

## Tech used
This project uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
and was created with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool.
